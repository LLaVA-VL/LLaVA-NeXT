# üåã LLaVA: Large Language and Vision Assistant

## Release
- [2024/04/20] üî• Releasing new **LLaVA-NeXT** Models with support of LLama-3 and Qwen-1.5 models, we now have Llama-3-LLaVA-NeXT-8B/72B and LLaVA-Next-72B model. You could check our [results]() and [checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/collections/lmms-lab/llava-next-6623288e2d61edba3ddbf5ff) to see improved performance!
- [2024/03/10] ‚ùÑÔ∏è Releasing **LMMs-Eval**, a highly efficient evaluation pipeline we used when developing LLaVA-NeXT. It supports the evaluation of LMMs on dozens of public datasets and allows new dataset onboarding, making the dev of new LMMs much faster. [[Blog](https://lmms-lab.github.io/lmms-eval-blog/lmms-eval-0.1/)] [[Codebase](https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/lmms-eval)]
- [2024/1/30] üî• **LLaVA-NeXT (LLaVA-1.6)** is out! With additional scaling to LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-NeXT-34B outperforms Gemini Pro on some benchmarks. It can now process 4x more pixels and perform more tasks/applications than before. Check out the [blog post](https://llava-vl.github.io/blog/2024-01-30-llava-next/), and explore the [demo](https://llava.hliu.cc/)! Models are available in [Model Zoo](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA/blob/main/docs/MODEL_ZOO.md). Training/eval data and scripts coming soon.

### Quick Start With HuggingFace

<details>
<summary>Example Code</summary>

```Python
from llava.model.builder import load_pretrained_model
from llava.mm_utils import get_model_name_from_path
from llava.eval.run_llava import eval_model

model_path = "liuhaotian/llava-v1.5-7b"

tokenizer, model, image_processor, context_len = load_pretrained_model(
    model_path=model_path,
    model_base=None,
    model_name=get_model_name_from_path(model_path)
)
```

Check out the details wth the `load_pretrained_model` function in `llava/model/builder.py`.

You can also use the `eval_model` function in `llava/eval/run_llava.py` to get the output easily. By doing so, you can use this code on Colab directly after downloading this repository.

``` python
model_path = "liuhaotian/llava-v1.5-7b"
prompt = "What are the things I should be cautious about when I visit here?"
image_file = "https://llava-vl.github.io/static/images/view.jpg"

args = type('Args', (), {
    "model_path": model_path,
    "model_base": None,
    "model_name": get_model_name_from_path(model_path),
    "query": prompt,
    "conv_mode": None,
    "image_file": image_file,
    "sep": ",",
    "temperature": 0,
    "top_p": None,
    "num_beams": 1,
    "max_new_tokens": 512
})()

eval_model(args)
```
