# About Training Scripts

We first release the basic training scripts for LLaVA-NeXT. It's based on previous LLaVA's training scripts and researchers familiar with LLaVA will find it easy to use.

We will later release the more detailed training scripts for our LLaVA OneVision models including the mid stage, single-image final stage and one-vision final stage.
> They are basically the same as the basic training scripts, but with some modifications, such as the data yaml.
