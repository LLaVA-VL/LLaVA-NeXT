## LLaVA-NeXT-Video is upgraded üöÄ

In our [LLaVA-Video blog](https://llava-vl.github.io/blog/2024-04-30-llava-next-video/) released this April, we shared two key observations: 
- üé¨ AnyRes provides a shared and flexible representation between images and videos, and thus accommodates capability transfer between the two most common vision signals. Therefore, stronger image LMMs can naturally lead to stronger zero-shot video LMMs. 
- üóÇÔ∏è There is a lack of high-quality language-video data, including video instruction-following data, and thus naive tuning on existing public data at that time results in performance degradation. Therefore, there is an urgent need to build high-quality video captions and QA datasets to train LMMs for improved video performance.

Based on the insights, the new LLaVA-NeXT-Video in this release improves from two aspects:

- üé¨ A stronger image LMMs ([LLaVA-NeXT-32B-Qwen](https://huggingface.co/lmms-lab/llava-next-qwen-32b)), which is built by initializing from Qwen-1.5 32B LLM. We further initialize our video training from this image checkpoint.
- üóÇÔ∏è A new high-quality video dataset with 830k samples. It is combined with LLaVA-1.6 image training data, and applying the same image-video mixed training procedure leads to the new video model.
The new model achieves the best open-source performance in several video benchmarks including [Video-MME](https://video-mme.github.io/home_page.html#leaderboard).
