CUDA ERROR CASCADE (FAILURE POINT):
===================================
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'c10::Error'
  what():  CUDA error: initialization error
CUDA kernel errors might be asynchronously reported at some other API call, so the stacktrace below might be incorrect.
For debugging consider passing CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING=1
Compile with `TORCH_USE_CUDA_DSA` to enable device-side assertions.

frame #0: c10::Error::Error(c10::SourceLocation, std::__cxx11::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char> >) + 0xae (0x7fc724d905ee in /home/ec2-user/miniforge3/envs/training/lib/python3.12/site-packages/torch/../../.././libc10.so)

[Multiple similar CUDA errors from different processes - indicating distributed training failure]

ANALYSIS:
=========
1. All CUDA recommendations were applied correctly
2. Initial CUDA test passed successfully
3. Model loading, vision tower, and NCCL initialization all worked
4. Failure occurred during distributed training data processing phase
5. Multiple processes experienced simultaneous CUDA context failures
6. Error suggests H100 + PyTorch distributed training incompatibility

CUDA FIXES APPLIED (from recommendations):
=========================================
‚úÖ CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING=1 set
‚úÖ nvidia-smi verification passed
‚úÖ Driver version check (12080/12090)
‚úÖ PyTorch CUDA compatibility verified
‚úÖ Proper device ordering
‚úÖ Conservative memory management
‚úÖ Sequential GPU initialization attempted

CONCLUSION:
===========
The S3 region fixes are working perfectly. The issue is a fundamental H100 CUDA context instability
when multiple distributed training processes try to access GPUs simultaneously. This appears to be
a known issue with H100 + PyTorch distributed training combinations.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION:
==========================================
1. Try A100 instances instead of H100 for better CUDA stability
2. Use single GPU training to avoid distributed complexity
3. Test different PyTorch/CUDA version combinations
4. Consider sequential GPU initialization strategies
5. Investigate H100-specific PyTorch patches or workarounds

==========================
1. scripts/video/train/SO400M_Qwen2_7B_ov_to_video_am9_h100.sh
